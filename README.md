# Hack The Box Writeups

Welcome to my repository of Hack The Box writeups!

## Introduction

This repository contains my personal writeups for various challenges and boxes on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). Each writeup aims to provide insights into my approaches, methodologies, and the tools I used to solve the challenges.

## Writeups

Here you'll find writeups for both retired and active boxes. Please note that writeups for active boxes will only be published once they are retired, in accordance with Hack The Box's guidelines.
