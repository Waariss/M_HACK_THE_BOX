# Stop Drop and Roll

## Description &#x20;

The Fray: The Video Game is one of the greatest hits of the last... well, we don't remember quite how long. Our "computers" these days can't run much more than that, and it has a tendency to get repetitive...

### **Introduction**

In the realm of cyber competitions, challenges often simulate realistic scenarios requiring quick thinking and automation skills. "THE FRAY: THE VIDEO GAME" challenge was an exemplary test of such skills, where participants had to interact with a remote service to prove their mettle. The game provided scenarios requiring precise responses to conquer the virtual "GAUNTLET".

### **Challenge Breakdown**

Upon connecting to the service via `netcat`, the game described three distinct scenarios â€” GORGE, PHREAK, or FIRE. Each scenario necessitated a specific response:

* GORGE required the participant to respond with STOP.
* PHREAK necessitated a ROLL response.
* FIRE called for the DROP response.

The twist came with combined scenarios, where multiple commands had to be sent back in sequence.

### **Solution Strategy**

To tackle this challenge efficiently, manual interaction was not practical. Thus, a Python script was developed to automate the communication with the service. The script's algorithm was straightforward but effective:

* Connect to the remote service using the socket library.
* Listen for the challenge's prompt.
* Parse the received message and determine the appropriate response based on the rules.
* Send the response back to the server.
* Repeat the process until the server sent the flag, signaling the challenge's completion.

```python
import socket
import re

def main():
    host = "83.136.254.16"
    port = 30311

    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((host, port))
        s.settimeout(2)  

        def send_message(message):
            print(f"Sending: {message}")
            s.sendall(message.encode() + b"\n")
        
        def receive_until_prompt(prompt="Are you ready? (y/n)"):
            received_data = ""
            while True:
                try:
                    data = s.recv(1024).decode()
                    if not data:
                        break
                    received_data += data
                    if "HTB{" in received_data:
                        print("Flag detected, stopping:", received_data)
                        return "STOP"
                    if prompt in received_data:
                        break
                except socket.timeout:
                    break
            print("Received:", received_data)
            return received_data

        receive_until_prompt()

        send_message("y")

        while True:
            game_data = receive_until_prompt("What do you do?")
            if game_data == "STOP":
                print("Flag found, exiting...")
                break
            if "What do you do?" in game_data:
                scenarios = re.findall(r'(GORGE|PHREAK|FIRE)', game_data)
                responses = {'GORGE': 'STOP', 'PHREAK': 'DROP', 'FIRE': 'ROLL'}
                response = '-'.join([responses[scenario] for scenario in scenarios])
                send_message(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Flag**

Through the use of Python for automation, the responses were sent accurately and swiftly, satisfying the conditions set forth by the game.
