# Fake Boost

## Description &#x20;

In the shadow of The Fray, a new test called ""Fake Boost"" whispers promises of free Discord Nitro perks. It's a trap, set in a world where nothing comes without a cost. As factions clash and alliances shift, the truth behind Fake Boost could be the key to survival or downfall. Will your faction see through the deception? KORPâ„¢ challenges you to discern reality from illusion in this cunning trial.

### **Introduction**

After downloading a `capture.pcapng` file and opening it with Wireshark, the focus was to examine the exported objects within this network communication.&#x20;

This exploration led to the discovery of three distinct files.

### **Discovery of Files**

**freediscordnitro**: This file was full of base64 characters, which initially seemed undecodable. Opting to move forward, it was set aside for later examination.

**rj1893rj1joijdkajwda**: Enclosed within this file were characters that appeared to be decode with base 64 and encrypted with AES.

**rj1893rj1joijdkajwda(1)**: Merely containing the text "OK," it didn't present anything of immediate interest.

### **Decoding Attempts and Successes**

Persisting with the `freediscordnitro` file, a breakthrough was achieved by reversing the base64 text before attempting to decode it again.

Utilizing Burp Suite for the decoding process unveiled it as an AES encryption code alongside a Free Discord Nitro 2024 offer, which also included a part of the flag encoded in base64.

Decoding this base64 text revealed the first segment of the flag.

### **Unlocking the AES-Encrypted File**

Further analysis led to the discovery of the AES key.

The next step involved decoding the contents of the `rj1893rj1joijdkajwda` file from base64, followed by decrypting the text using the AES key.

This decryption process unearthed details including an ID, Email, GlobalName, and Token.

### Flag

Focusing on the EMAIL and decoding it resulted in uncovering the second part of the flag.
